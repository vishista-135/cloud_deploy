0,These are darling! I love how dainty and sparkly they are. They fit my 2nd piercing perfectly- I get worried with crawler earrings that they'll be too long. These are so cute! I'd totally buy from this seller again.
1,Absolutely stunning! I am in love with these earrings! Very fast shipping and cute packaging ‚ù§
2,"Got these once before for me and my brides maids on my wedding day! They're perfect, mine lost a jewel somewhere along the way (a year ago, and I stored them in my coin purse, not the best place for something to beautiful!), so I decided to order another set!"
3,"I love how dainty and unique they are.  I got the gold and I'm glad I did.  You don't really notice the gold, but I feel it makes the stones pop."
4,"This is a really beautiful piece! I had been looking for a new crawler to put in my upper cartilage piercing, and it works perfect (once I figured out which one works best with my ear curve!) but it‚Äôs beautifully done and I really love the style of the baguettes in the earring! Love love love! And super quick shipping"
5,I absolutely LOVE my earrings! They are so unique and dainty. I‚Äôve had so many compliments on them already and Connor wait to wear them for the wedding I‚Äôm in next week. I would recommend ordering from MilysDesign! My order was processed quickly and came wrapped safely in bubble wrap so the earrings wouldn‚Äôt get damaged.
6,Soooo dainty and sparkly. Can‚Äôt wait to wear them for an art-deco feel.  UPDATE: I went to bend the wire back a tad to be able to get it into my piercing hole and the whole back broke off :( hot glue won‚Äôt hold it and I‚Äôm so sad! I‚Äôll keep the one for a mix n match look but be careful because these babies are delicate!!!
7,"These are so pretty, I've gotten lots of compliments.  If I could do it over, I'd probably go with the post backs instead of the wire, but that's just personal preference.  You do beautiful work!!!"
8,"Wasn't exactly flush to my ear like I was hoping from the picture, but I was able to move it a bit and adjust it so it was. It's beautiful otherwise! Fast shipping."
9,The pieces are beautiful and fitted. I plan on buying more soon
10,These are stunning! I absolutely love them! Same as picture!

15,"Love them! They fit great and were exactly as advertised. It was my first time trying climber earrings, and I got the wire back."
16,I love how dainty and cute this is! My only wish was that the backing wasn‚Äôt a post and more of a longer ear jacket. But i love it!

29,"So glad I took a chance and ordered these beautiful earrings. I have minimalist taste, especially when it comes to jewelry. The earrings can be worn around the house in quarantine with a sweatshirt or in the event I go somewhere special again some day, they can easily compliment the dressiest of outfits. They make me feel pretty and I highly recommend them to anyone. This will be my go to shop for gifts for friends or when I want to treat myself."

36,Super pretty and delicate earrings.  Just 4 of 5 because they don‚Äôt always stay in place on my ears; I find them trailing off the end of my earlobes.  Which is still pretty but up to your personal preference. My experience with the shop was very positive. Quick shipping and well packaged. Will shop here again.
37,Very cute earrings. They stay in nicely (ear climbers are tricky so sometimes you do have to pinch the very end). These are a simple design that can be worn with pretty much anything!
38,These are even more beautiful in person! I love them!
39,Love them! They look so pretty and I can‚Äôt wait to show them off! I definitely want to purchase more for friends and family in the future!
40,"one of my favorite earrings i‚Äôve bought so far. i love it, it has a very classy look to it but i‚Äôd wear it everyday!"
41,"I bought these adorable earrings as a birthday gift for my granddaughter. I gave her two sets and she shared the second set with me, Grammy!! The only thing I would have to say in regards to making them better.... they stay on your ears much more secure with a larger back on the earrings. They tend to slip down on your ear with the small earring back that they come with. Still rate them a 5 star!!  We love  ‚Äòem!!"
42,"I  really like the earrings,had a few compliments  already (very pretty)"
43,Beautiful earrings!! Will buy from this shop again! ‚ù§Ô∏è

45,"I'm super impressed with Lucy's professionalism and how easy she is to work with. One of my earrings arrived missing a stone, and she sent me a replacement in two days. She didn't ask me to send to flawed piece back to her either, which I appreciate (shipping fees). I'll definitely buy from her again, and would encourage my friends to buy from her too. I love the dainty sparkle of the earrings in my chubby ear next to my larger diamonds; they look like a trellis leading to a flower. I'm very, very happy with my purchase ‚ù£Ô∏è"
46,"Love these ear climbers.Very petite and feminine!"
47,Beautiful product. I got the post back first and it didn‚Äôt sit right so seller let me return and meanwhile I purchased a wire back which fit perfectly. Very happy!

72,"They are so pretty!! Unfortunately my ears start itching when I have them on so I  guess I'm allergic to them. Also, I chose the post back and the tail of the earrings kept sliding down instead of staying up in place. I do not recommend the post back. If your ears aren't as sensitive as mine to certain earrings then I do recommend these cuz they are really pretty, its just a shame it didn't work out for me."

These have stayed in for 4 days now and have not bothered my ears. I have not received compliments on them, my sister told me they look fake and she wouldn‚Äôt buy them. But that‚Äôs what sisters do. I think these are just fine for my purposes and will be keeping them in. Fast shipping as well"

188,"I needed help with my order, but I have yet to hear back from the owner."
189,They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry

192,"I love them! Very subtle and elegant!  It did take quite a while for me to receive them.  But since I ordered them during the holiday seasons and it's overseas shipping, I understand the delay.  The owner responded quickly to my message regarding the shipping delay.  So I am very happy with the purchase:)"

196,They are stunning I‚Äôm obsessed!

198,"It did ship on time and was very nicely wrapped and boxed! Lovely earrings...but the first time I attempted to put them in my ears, the post s broke off. Now I have to try to glue these tiny things on so that I can wear them...they obviously were not flexible , at all! Very disappointing. Especially because they were so important to me...the moon phases...and unique! :(:("

235,"Wore them for about two days and absolutely loved them. Unfortunately they broke as I took them off on the third day. Edit: The shop owner was extremely considerate and thoughtful. She reached out to me and very kindly was able to resolve the issue. I would recommend the shop to others not only because of the beautiful pieces but especially because of the kind shop owner, Claudia."

284,Lovely earrings! One thing to beware is that these funky bars do not hold very well and my mother lost one the very first time she was wearing it. Highly recommend purchasing little rubber backers to add to the bar to hold these in place.

294,"These ear climbers are super pretty, I love the style but for some reason they hurt my ears and caused lots of irritation. I do not have sensitive skin and always clean earrings before I wear them so I‚Äôm not sure what the issue is for me. Anyway, I‚Äôve ordered the sterling silver ones of the same story and hope my ears are happier. I really like this shop, such pretty and interesting jewelry!"

309,"Really nice + comfortable earrings, I love them!"
310,"Beautifully and thoughtfully packaged, shipped on time; Unfortunately the earrings don't lay completely flat upwards along the ear meaning that I had to make sure to readjust ie. reposition them onto my ear. I think gently pushing down on the bracket should help keep it in place in future. Still a pretty and unique piece of jewelry."

332,Nice earrings but the mechanism that holds them along my ear lobe doesn‚Äôt always hold and they slip down.

334,Earrings were poorly manufactured. Broken out of packaging. Cute concept
335,"Pretty but needed to return product to  arriving too late. Now getting frustrated trying to see if this is resolves I keep getting the ring around and people keep having.me email different folks to find out how to return these earrings,  I would not reccomend ordering from this site again if I can't get it resolved in the week ne"
336,Very nice.  Received on time as well.
337,unfortunately it broke before I could use it :(
338,"The packing was nice, but one of the earrings was bent and I still wore it; however the earring fell off and I lost it the same day i received it. The earring that was bent would not stay in my ear."
339,"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
340,Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D

343,"This is the third set of these I have purchased. I own a pair in gold and receive so many compliments, that I‚Äôve started gifting them to people who love them!"
344,"I've left a review before, but I have started to but these quite often as everyone who sees them likes them and comments on them, so I have a load in reserve to gift people. I adore these, they're perfect. I've tried buying from other makers who may be closer, but I haven't found anyone who makes them as well."
345,"I absolutely love ear crawlers, but this is hands on the most elegant pair I‚Äôve ever bought. Outstanding quality and so delicate you‚Äôd almost forget you‚Äôre wearing them!"
346,"Fair wait, light, delicate and elegant I think."
347,Beautiful. Difficult to put on ear because of the double long piece. Still love it.

349,So cute! Love these!
